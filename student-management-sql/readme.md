# Oracle SQL Mini Project - Student Management System

This is a mini Oracle SQL project that demonstrates the use of:

- Table creation with constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, CHECK)
- INSERT statements with sample data
- SQL JOINs (INNER JOIN)
- Realistic student and department data use case

## üóÉÔ∏è Tables Used

1. `DEPARTMENT`  
2. `STUDENT`

## üîç SQL Features Demonstrated

- `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `CHECK`
- `JOIN` between `STUDENT` and `DEPARTMENT` tables
- Filtering with `WHERE` and combining conditions

## üìä Sample Output (From Join Query)
